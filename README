*** pi_car ***

pi_car is a C program for controlling a motorized car from a Raspberry Pi.

In the current iteration, it uses SDL to read the analog stick position
from a bluetooth gamepad to control the car speed and direction. PIGPIO is used
to translate that information into PWM signals to send to the motors via GPIO.
Future versions of this project will take speed information gathered from
opto-isolated switches and distance info from an IR time-of-flight detector
to add more interesting functions (e.g. distance measurements, crash avoidance).

To build the project, simply type 'make' in a terminal window.
To run it, type './pi_car'
Make sure your bluetooth gamepad is connected before starting the program.
To quit, press any button on the gamepad (for now).
